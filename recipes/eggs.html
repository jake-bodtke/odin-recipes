    <h2>Jalapeno Bacon Cheddar Deviled Eggs</h2>
    <p>A spin on an old classic. Deviled eggs with the addition of savory bacon, delicious Cheddar and spicy jalapeno.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>3 jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>1 cup finely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ red onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika, or as desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Place eggs in a saucepan; cover with water. Bring to a boil, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water, cool under cold running water, and peel.</li> 
       <li>Place bacon in a large skillet; cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels; crumble when cool enough to handle.</li> 
       <li>Remove seeds and stems from jalapenos; mince 1 pepper and slice remaining peppers into very thin strips; set aside.</li> 
       <li>Cut eggs in half lengthwise; place yolks in a bowl. Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in minced jalapeno, Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, red onion, and mustard.</li> 
       <li>Place egg whites cut-side up on a serving platter. Spoon yolk mixture into egg white halves; sprinkle with crumbled bacon and paprika.</li> 
    </ol>
